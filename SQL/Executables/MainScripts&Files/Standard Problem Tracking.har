Note=The Standard Problem Tracking Model is used by organizations that want to put a life cycle into place for evaluating problem information on forms.  This model allows management to track the time a problem was created, the length of time taken to investigate the information, and the disposition of that investigation.  When it is determined that the problem should be worked on, it is moved to a development environment.
