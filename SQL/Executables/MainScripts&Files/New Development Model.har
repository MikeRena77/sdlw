Note=The New Development Model is used by organizations that are developing a new application.  This model gives a separate work area for Requirements, Development, Test, and Documentation.  This model is designed to keep track of requirements, design documents,  rapid prototyping of software, design of test scripts, and project type documentation.  The result of this model is a baseline that is used to start the Production or Release models.
