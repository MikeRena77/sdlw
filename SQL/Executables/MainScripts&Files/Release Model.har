Name=Release Model
Template=1
Active=0
=1653
Note=The Release Model is used by organizations that make many changes to an application and release those changes as a group identified by a release number.  That release is then taken and used as a starting point for the next development effort.

The default Release Model has three basic states: Development, Test, and Release.  Changes are isolated in each state so that the changes made in Development won’t affect the testing effort, and the contents of Test do not affect the versions that have been released.
The flow through the life cycle starts when a fix is required and a package is created.  This package has an associated change request form which details the changes that are needed.  Anyone can create a change package.  When the change is ready for work, the software is checked out for update and the changes are made.  The changes are then checked back into CCC/Harvest and are associated with the initiating package.  When the changes are ready for implementation, the packages are promoted to the Test state.  When all the testing is done, the packages are promoted to the Release state.
When the next release is ready to begin, or if an emergency fix needs to implemented, a snapshot is created.  This snapshot is used to create a new environment where additional development will be isolated.  For example, you are working on Release 1.0 and it is out for Beta testing.  You now want to start working on Release 2.0.  You would create a snapshot of Release 1.0 Beta and use it to create the Release 2.0 environment.  Any changes made to the Release 2.0 environment will not be seen by the Release 1.0 environment, and visa versa.

Note=This process is used to check in new or modified files to the repository.  You must have reserved an existing item before you can check it back in.  Only Developers have access to execute this process.  You must specify the package these changes are associated with.  When the file is checked in, the reserve tag is removed, the new revision of the item is placed in the repository,  the file properties are changed to read-only, and the signature file in the directory from which the file is checked in is updated.

To merge the changes, select the package on the Workbench that will be associated with the new versions, invoke this process, and use the Harvest-Level Package Chooser to select packages from the source environment that contain the desired versions.

If there are any merge issues that must be resolved, a merge tag is placed on the trunk.  This merge tag prevents users from checking in new changes of the item to the trunk until the merge conflicts are resolved by running the Interactive Merge process.

Note=This process is used to remove an item from the current view.  This means that the item is marked with a remove tag, so when the Version Chooser options Latest in View or  All in View are used, the item is no longer seen.  This has the same effect as removing the item from the repository, but the item retains its history and can be later restored by deleting the remove-tagged version.
