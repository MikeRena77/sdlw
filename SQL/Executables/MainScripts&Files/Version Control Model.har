Name=Version Control Model
Template=1
Active=0
=593
Note=The Version Control Model is used by organizations that want to track versions of their software.  The environment is initially set up with one package that tracks all of the changes to the code.  This package is used as a default during check in and check out operations.  If an organization wants to start separating out their changes they can create other packages within this model.  As an organization expands its use of CCC/Harvest, snapshots of changes in this environment can be created and used as a basis for other environments, such as the Production or New Development models.

Note=This state is where the bulk of the work in this life cycle takes place.  When you first create this environment, create a package in this state that all files are checked in and checked out with.  If there is only one package in this state, it will be used as the default package for all check in and check out operations.  You must create at least one package when you create this environment.

When a snapshot context is chosen, the versions visible on the Workbench are the versions captured by the snapshot view.

Name=Check In Items

Note=This process is used to check in new or modified files to the repository.  You must have reserved an existing item before you can check it back in.  Only Developers have access to execute this process.  You must specify the package these changes are associated with if more than one package exists in this state.  When the file is checked in, the reserve tag is removed, the new revision of the item is placed in the repository,  the file properties are changed to read-only, and the signature file in the directory from which the file is checked in is updated.

Note=This process is used to check out an item for Update.  Only a Developer can invoke this process.  The developer must specify a package that the changes will be associated with if more than one package resides in this state.  When an item is checked out a reserve tag is placed on the item so that no other user can make modifications to this item.
For simplicity, this process can also work the same as Check Out for Browse.

If more than one package exists in the environment, you will need to select from the available packages.  You may create as many packages as needed in this environment.

Name=Remove Item
=449
Note=This process is used to remove an item from the view.  This means that the item is marked with a remove tag, so when the Version Chooser options Latest in View or  All in View are used, the item is no longer seen.  This has the same effect as removing the item from the repository, but the item retains its history and can be later restored by deleting the remove-tagged version.  Only the Development Manager has access to invoke this process.
