I'm no harvest pro yet, but I see what I think is an error in your hco
statment.  vp is the view path not the client path.  use -cp when you specify
d:\RepTestVerfahren.  in the -vp argument put a '/'(forward slash) and then
the name of your repository. so that it looks more like this

-vp /MyRepository -cp d:\MyDir

I imagine that you have the problem solved by now, but just in case...
