Subject: [Visual Source Safe] Re: Database Connections - 40851
From: Niels Andersen 
To: Visual Source Safe 

The VSS database information is kept in a registry key under 

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Sourcesafe

open regedit.exe, move to the above location and select File\Export.
Type in VssSettings and hit enter. Close Regedit again and be very careful using it, you can do lots of damage in there.

There should now be a file called VssSettings.reg in you MyDocuments folder.
Copy this file to your new computer and when you have installed VSS on it, doubleclick on the VssSettings.reg file to install the settings on the new pc.

*** Important ***
The directions above assumes that the Vss Database you are using exist on a network server. If you use a local database then you must also copy the entire database to the new computer.
To do this the old and new computers must be connected on a network (If your VSS datab ase is small you might be able to back it up to a recordable CD or DVD).

Install Vss on the new PC and then copy the entire VSS folder from the old PC to the new one overwriting everything.

VSS is usually located in the following folder:
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Common Files\VSS

Hop this helps

Niels
