A CCC/Harvest UDP to check for package set upon promote

Requirements:

CCC/Harvest 3.0 or better, NT server with perl interpreter.

What it does:

This UDP prevents pacakge sets from being promoted without their set members.

The set philosophy is that you can promote a package forward if you are promoting all 
of the packages contained within the set that the package belongs to.  A package cannot 
promote ahead of any of its set.  A package can however catch up to a set if it had been
demoted back.  In other words, sets bind packages together upon promote, but not upon 
demote. A package set is similar to a package group. However, a package set doesn't
require an administrator to create it. Also a package can only belong to a single set.

Set_check.pl looks to see if [package] and [package]-1 exist in the current state. 
Set_check1.pl looks to see if [package], [package]-1, and [package]-2 exist in the current
state.


How it works:

From the Workbench, the user executes this UDP process, first selecting a Package or a 
list of Packages from the ones available in a State. The UDP is either a shell script 
on UNIX or a Perl script on NT that gets passed the environment name, state name, and 
package name(s).  The scripts checks the set of the selected packages. If any package 
set rules are violated, details are displayed and the UDP causes the promote process 
to halt.


Usage:  

Modify the set_check.sh or set_check.pl file, specifying on the $username and $userpass 
lines the user name and password of your read-only CCC/Harvest Oracle database user.
(HARREP/HARVEST is the default)
Also specify on the $husername and $huserpass the user name and password of the Harvest
account to be used by hcp command.

Put set_check.sh, making sure it is executable, in $HARVESTHOME/bin on your UNIX server.
OR,
Put eset_check.pl in %HARVESTHOME%\bin on your NT server.

In CCC/Harvest, set up a UDP process with the following 
program line:

UNIX:
set_check.sh [environment] [state] [package]
NT Harvest 3.x
perl.exe set_check.pl " [environment] " " [state] " " [package] " 
NT Harvest 4.x
perl.exe set_check.pl  "[environment]"   "[state]"   "[package]"  

Note that the spaces are required around the bracketed variables, but within the quotes
this allows the system variables to be translated by harvest, yet allows values with
spaces to be interpreted by perl as one arg rather than a list.  The extra space at the
beginning and the extra space at the end are removed.

This UDP assumes that a "Promote" package promote process exists in the source 
environment/state.

Limitations:  

If you have an NT server, then the package names may not contain any whitespace.  
Unfortunately, a PC-based UDP has no way of distinguishing a space within a parameter 
from a space that separates one parameter from the next.
